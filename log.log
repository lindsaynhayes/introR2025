1. fork and update
- fork jhustatprogramming2024 from stephaniehicks
- make updates to readme, index, and syllabus files

2. try to deploy and ran into problems I think bc link to Dr. Hicks gh-pages authentication.
I think there were multiple problems:
- git authentication link was not set up correction
- maybe the fork links to Hick's directory
- also want to find a way to when the page renders it automatically goes to gh-pages branch and not main _sites directory

try to solve these problems one-by-one

3. Set up proper authentication because git clone or git push was failing to authenticate
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git

- Cloning with HTTPS URLs
- Download GitHub CLI (https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
sudo port install gh
sudo port selfupdate && sudo port upgrade gh
- I think the selfupdate worked but the port upgrade did not moved forward anyway
gh auth login
select https
Y to credentials
- success!

4. Detach fork (kinda a scary process but it did work)
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork
- in terminal create a clone of the fork
git clone --bare https://github.com/lindsaynhayes/introR2025.git
- created a new directory introR2025.git with some wierd files in it
- delete the forked director (scary yes, make a back up)
- create a new responsitory from scratch with the same name introR2025
- Mirror-push the repository back to teh same remote URL. This failed at first because of the credential thing, but if the above works then this will work.
git --git-dir introR2025.git push --mirror https://github.com/lindsaynhayes/introR2025.git
- what do you know it indeed worked and now I have the right files in the directory and a gh-pages branch. AND the correct .html files in the gh-pages branch, my version not Hick's version. I do not know how that happened, but its what I wanted. Hicks is now listed as a contributor on the repository. Great!
- remove the .git directory
rm -rf introR2025.git

5. Next look into how to get it to build the site to gh-pages instead of main branch so the .qmd files are in main and the htmls are in gh-pages. 


6. Tips & Tricks
draft: true in yml heading makes the page not render on the webiste. useful when you know about it!
