# Overview

**Due date: 07/15/25 at 11:59pm**

This week we introduced the Tidyverse collection of R packages. The packages covered are commonly used in biomedical research data analysis. These packages are well-documented online by their creators and user communities. If you have a question about any of the packages, googling will likely give you a solution from a forum of someone else having the same question or issue. 

In this week's Swirl lessons, you'll explore one of the core Tidyverse packages: ggplot2. This powerful package makes it easy to transform tidydata into informative visualizations while allowing easy plot management and customization.

Through the lessons for this week, you will learn the following:

- Using base methods to produce plots
- Customizing plots
- The basics of GGPlot2 and a little more

# Swirl Course Setup

1.  In RStudio, load in the swirl package

    `library("swirl")`

    `swirl()`
    
3. Navigate to this [link](https://github.com/lindsaynhayes/introR2025/tree/main/swirl) to download the Swirl lesson file 2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.swc

4. Once you have downloaded the file, in the console of RStudio run the following command and interactively choose the 2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.swc file you just downloaded

- If you start a lesson, please complete it fully before taking a break. If you stop RStudio in the middle of a lesson, your progress for that lesson may still be saved in the history for that package locally, but will not be saved or sent to us on the instructor's end.
