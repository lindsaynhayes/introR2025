# Overview

**Due date: 07/25/25 at 11:59pm**

This week's Swirl lessons cover the following:

-   Dimension reduction techniques and examples
-   Simple clustering methods and examples

# Swirl Course Setup

1.  In RStudio, load in the swirl package

    `library("swirl")`

2.  *Navigate* to this [link](https://github.com/lindsaynhayes/introR2025/tree/main/swirl). *Download* the Swirl lesson file `3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.swc`. **Move** it into your working directory for the class.

3.  Once you have the file in your working directory, in the console of RStudio type the command below and after the `swc_path =` type `"` and then hit `tab` to interactively choose the `3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.swc` file you just downloaded from your working directory. The command will look something like `install_course(swc_path = "3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.swc")`. Run the command to install the course.

    `install_course(swc_path = )`

4.  Start Swirl by typing the following command

    `swirl()`

5.  Start the lesson by selecting `3 Exploratory Data Analysis`.

::: callout-important
-   You can take breaks **between** lessons (like shutting down Swirl and exiting RStudio), just use the same name when logging in for documenting purposes on the instructor's end.

-   If you start a lesson, please complete it fully before taking a break. If you stop RStudio in the middle of a lesson, your progress for that lesson may still be saved in the history for that package locally, but will not be saved or sent to us on the instructor's end.

-   If you do not get to the Google Form end of any lesson, please email one of the instructors as soon as possible.
