# Overview

**Due date: 07/08/25 at 11:59pm**

Most programming languages are similar in their underlying logic, but differ in execution, efficiency, and, more importantly, their syntax. R is one of the most popular languages used for data analysis in biomedical research. Its programming syntax is unique and differs from other popular languages in the same category as it like Python. Gaining a better understanding of R's core features and becoming familiar with its syntax will help you perform analyses more effectively and efficiently.

In the Swirl lessons for this week, you will learn the following:

-   Navigating files and directories
-   Assigning and using variables
-   Creating, modifying, and subsetting vectors
-   Creating and modifying sequences
-   Handling missing values
-   Simple matrices and dataframes
-   Logics (TRUE, FALSE, AND, OR, etc.) in R
-   Gain experience with base features in R

# Swirl Course Setup

1.  In RStudio, install and load the swirl package

    `install.packages("swirl")`

    `library("swirl")`

2.  **Navigate** to this [link](https://github.com/lindsaynhayes/introR2025/tree/main/swirl). **Download** the Swirl lesson file `1_R_Programming_Mod.swc`. **Move** it into your working directory for the class.

3.  Once you have the file in your working directory, in the console of RStudio type the command below and after the `swc_path =` type `"` and then hit `tab` to interactively choose the `1_R_Programming_Mod.swc` file you just downloaded from your working directory. The command will look something like `install_course(swc_path = "1_R_Programming_Mod.swc")`. Run the command to install the course.

    `install_course(swc_path = )`

4.  Start Swirl by typing the following command

    `swirl()`

# Working through the Lessons

::: callout-important
-   You can take breaks **between** lessons (like shutting down Swirl and exiting RStudio), just use the same name when logging in for documenting purposes on the instructor's end.

-   If you start a lesson, please complete it fully before taking a break. If you stop RStudio in the middle of a lesson, your progress for that lesson may still be saved in the history for that package locally, but will not be saved or sent to us on the instructor's end.

-   If you do not get to the Google Form end of any lesson, please email one of the instructors as soon as possible.
