# Export
```{r}

# base R
write.csv(data, file = "data/taylorswift.csv")

# Tidyverse
write_csv(data, file = "data/taylorswift.csv")


# Other types of ways to save data/objects in R

# Use saveRDS() to save one single R object as an .rds format
saveRDS(data, file = "data/taylorswift.rds")

# when you read it in you need to define the object
taylor <- readRDS(file = "data/taylorswift.rds")


# You can also save multiple objects altogether as one .rda format
save(data, types, plot1, file = "data/taylor_analysis.rda")

# when you read it back into R you just have to load the data and all the objects names are restored
load(file = "data/taylor_analysis.rda")

# Lastly, you can save your entire workspace all the objects, plots, data, values you've generated using save.image()
save.image(file = "taylor_workspacerda")

# then to restore the workspace you use load again
load(file = "taylor_workspace.rda")

```
