# Pre-lecture activities

::: callout-important

In advance of class, please read through: 

- [Lecture 08: Object Oriented Programming](../../readings/08-oop-paradigm/index.qmd)

In addition, please have a brief look through these four sections of the book:

### Learning objectives

**At the end of this lesson you will:**

- Recognize the primary object-oriented systems in R: S3, S4, R6, and Reference Classes (RC). 
- Understand the terminology of a **class**, **object**, **method**, **constructor** and **generic**.
- Be able to create a new S3 or S4 with generics and methods

# Class activity 

For the rest of the time in class, you and your team will work on the final project. Stephanie will walk around to answer questions and to help in anyway I can. 


# Post-lecture

## Summary 

- R has three object oriented systems: S3, S4, and Reference Classes. 
- Reference Classes are the most similar to classes and objects in other
programming languages.
- Classes are blueprints for an object.
- Objects are individual instances of a class.
- Methods are functions that are associated with a particular class.
- Constructors are methods that create objects.
- Everything in R is an object.
- S3 is a liberal object oriented system that allows you to assign a class to
any object.
- S4 is a more strict object oriented system that build upon ideas in S3.
- Reference Classes are a modern object oriented system that is similar to Java,
C++, Python, or Ruby.


## Additional practice

Here are some additional practice questions to help you think about the material discussed.
