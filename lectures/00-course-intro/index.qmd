# Pre-lecture activities

Before each class, there will be a set of pre-lecture activities and/or readings for you to complete. **It is important these activities be done before class so that you can benefit the most from the in-class activities**. 

Today we will cover the [Pre-reading material about quarto](../../readings/00-quarto/index.qmd) as a way to demonstrate where to find the pre-reading materials going forward. Sometimes, there will not be pre-reading materials here, but rather direct links to external resources that you need to read in advance.

### Questions

1.  Create a new Quarto document using *File \> New File \> Quarto Document*. Read the instructions. Practice running the chunks individually. Then render the document by clicking the appropriate button and then by using the appropriate keyboard short cut. Verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output.

2.  Create one new Quarto document for each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. Render each of the three documents. How do the outputs differ? How do the inputs differ? (You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output --- RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary.)
