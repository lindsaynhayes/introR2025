This creates an empty GitHub repository. You need to show all your code and submit both the `.qmd` file and the rendered HTML file. Please include section headers for each of the components below. All plots should have titles, subtitles, captions, and human-understandable axis labels. The TAs will grade the contents in the GitHub Classroom repo by cloning the repo and checking for all the things described below. \n\nBecause you will work with a partner, **please be sure to include the names, emails, and JHED IDs for both individuals in your submitted work**. \n\n# Part 1 \n\nTBA \n\n# Part 2\n\nTBA ",
