## Github {background-image="figures/template/border_1.png" .center}

- Online based platform that is used, along with git, for version control of software projects and makes collaboration easier between developers

- Version control means tracking modifications, creations, and deletions of project files

- Connects your local development enviroment, or local repository, to online/cloud based storage, remote reposiroty, to keep track of modifications and make it easier to share with others

---

## Quarto {background-image="figures/template/border_1.png" .center}

- Open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows for the use of narrative text with code

- However not just limited to a singular file, allows for easy setup of other types of project like websites, presentations, dashboards, books, etc. 

- The ability to change formats easily and incoporate other languages than only R removes previous limitations and allows for better communication of projects and workflows

## Project Benefits of using Github and Quarto {background-image="figures/template/border_1.png" .center}

- **Easier Publication Submission** - Everything is together and well documented (hopefullyðŸ¤ž) to be submitted for publication

- **Reproducibility** - allows others to easily have access to how an analysis was done and be able to replicate it

- **Branding** - Having an online resume/cv of all your projects and those you have collaborated on with others

## Setting Up Your First Quarto Website on GitHub {.center background-image="figures/template/title_1.png"}

## 1 - Setup Repository Online {.scrollable .center}

Click on the New Repo button.

Name your Repo and click the Create Repository button.

![](figures/L07/slides/github_repo_create.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

Once on the page below, click Set up in Desktop.

## 2 - Set Up Remote Repository Locally through Github Desktop {.scrollable}

Once in Github Desktop, pick what directory you would like to store the repository locally. This action will create a remote repository connecting it to the one you have online.

![](figures/L07/slides/github_desktop_setup.png){width=800 fig-align=center}

---

## 3 - Open RStudio and Set Repository as Working Directory {.scrollable}

Navigate to your remote repository through the files window.

---

## 4 - Setting Up Quarto Website Project in Repository {.scrollable}
Type the following command in the terminal to create an RProject and setup a quarto website, a new window of RStudio will appear:
  
```{.bash}
  quarto create project website
```
  
On the new Rstudio window refresh and check out the new files by refreshing the files window:

  - _quarto.yml
  - index.qmd
  - about.qmd
  - styles.css

---

## 5 - Commiting and Pushing to Github Repository {.scrollable}

In Github desktop type a commit message and commit to main.
  
![](figures/L07/slides/github_desktop_commit.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

After commiting your changes and message, hit publish to origin.

## 6 - Setting Up to Publish to Github Pages using a gh-pages branch {.scrollable}
In Github website refresh and view all branches in the repository by following the steps below:
  
![](figures/L07/slides/branch_button.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

![](figures/L07/slides/branch_new_button.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

Make sure to name it gh-pages, it has to be named this in order for your website to work.

## 7 - Setting Up Github Pages and Workflows Locally {.scrollable}

Back in R studio do the following:
    
  - Create text file named ".nojekyll", it does not need to contain anything.
    
  - Create ".github" folder, then a folder named workflows inside .github, then a text file named "publish.yml"
    
  - Copy and paste below into the publish.yml:
  
```{.bash filename="publish.yml"}
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## 8 - Commit and Push Changes to Host Website on Github Pages {.center}

---

## 9 - Check Settings and Website {.scrollable}
Navigate to settings of your repository.
  
![](figures/L07/slides/repo_settings.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

Then navigate to pages.

![](figures/L07/slides/repo_pages.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

In pages make sure that under Build and Deployment Source is Deploy from Branch. Also make sure that under Branch that gh-pages is selected from /(root) like below:

## 10 - Visit Your Website! {.center}

![](figures/L07/slides/website_link.png){width=900 fig-align=center}

---

## Customizing Your Website {.center background-image="figures/template/title_1.png"}

## Lets edit your Home Page: `index.qmd` { background-image="figures/template/border_2.png" .center}

```{.bash filename="publish.yml"}
---
title: "NAME"
image: headshot.png
toc: false
about:
  template: trestles
  links:
    - text: GitHub
      href: link
    - text: Email
      href: link
---

::: {.column-page}

## Bio

## Research Goals

## Experience

:::
```

---

## Setting up your project {.scrollable background-image="figures/template/border_2.png"}

- Create a new Quarto document named projects - `projects.qmd` - with the following content:

```{.bash filename="projects.qmd"}
---
title: "Projects"
listing:
  id: projects-listings
  contents: projects
  sort: "date asc"
  type: table
  categories: false
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: false
date-format: "MM-DD-YYYY"
---

::: {#Projects-listings}
:::
```

- Create a **projects** folder

- Move `about.qmd` to the projects folder and rename it to your **project_title.qmd**

- Now change the listing in the `_quarto.yml`:

```{.bash filename="_quarto.yml"}
website:
  title: "Test_website"
  navbar:
    right:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: projects.qmd
        text: Projects
```

## Changing your `publish.yml` to run R code {.scrollable background-image="figures/template/border_2.png"}

To run your Quarto R code cells and have their output displayed on your website (without errors) you must add R enviroment development step to your workflow file:

```{.bash filename="publish.yml"}
name: Quarto Publish

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main
    
jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.2'
      
      - name: Set up R Dependencies 
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
        with:
          packages:
            any::knitr
            any::rmarkdown
            any::tidyverse
            any::taylor
            any::GGally
            any::ggstats
            any::cowplot
            any::lme4
            any::lmerTest
            any::palmerpenguins
            any::tidymodels
            any::psycModel 
            
      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Add your dataset to your working directory {.center background-image="figures/template/border_2.png"}

## Since we have time - Make it more personal {.scrollable background-image="figures/template/border_3.png"}

- Change .css to .scss and change the file to the following:

```{.bash filename="styles.scss"}
/*-- scss:defaults --*/

// Colors
$dark-green: #596b57;
$light-green: #D1D9CE;
$cream: #FDFBF7;
$gray: #64605f;
$purple: #9158A2;
$orange: #ad7237;
$black: #151617;

// Base document colors
$navbar-bg: $dark-green; // navbar
$navbar-fg: $cream; // navbar foreground elements
$navbar-hl: $light-green; // highlight color when hovering over navbar links
$body-bg: $cream; // page background 
$body-color: $black; // page text 
$footer-bg: $cream; // footer 

// Inline code
$code-bg: $cream; // inline code background color
$code-color: $orange; // inline code text color
```

- In `_quarto.yml` change the following:

```{.bash filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: styles.scss
    toc: true
```
