Dimension Reduction
data transformation; 
M: transformed predictors
P: number of predictors
N: number of observations

Curse of dimensionality: 
  as the dimenstionality inccreassa, space increases so fast the data become too sparseMatrixStats.
  cant distinguish signal from noise.


Feature Selection
Feature Extraction

PCA: Principal component analysis
Euclidean, orthogonal and uncorrelated, linear

IDC: Independent Component Analysis
Cocktail party problem

MDS: Multidimensional Scaling
non-linear dimension reduction
preserves pairwise distance
computationally expensive

t-SNE
probability that two points are similar, non-linear

UMAP
non-linear
geometry based, preserve global structure
manifold
