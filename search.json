Students may be required to provide documentation of the reason for the absence and may be required to complete supplementary assignments to make up for missed activities, but the course director and/or instructors are not required to provide make-up opportunities for missed discussions. Each unexcused absence will trigger a 10 point reduction in attendance points (see evaluation and grading below). If a session cannot be in person due to illness or weather, the session may be given by zoom. In such cases, every effort will be made to communicate any changes and to record the session for those that cannot attend synchronously.\nUnexcused lateness of more than 10 minutes will be recorded as an absence. Egregious lack of engagement (e.g., work unrelated to the course, messaging/texting, or using social media for more than 10 minutes of class) will be counted as an absence."

For this course we will be using R version 4.4.1. You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console R.version.string and hitting the return/enter key. If you do not have this version of R installed, go to CRAN and download and install the latest version. Newer versions may also work but considerably older versions should be avoided.\nWe will work primarily in RStudio which is an interactive development environment (IDE) for R. RStudio requires that R be installed, and so is an “add-on” to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the RStudio web site. In particular, we will make heavy use of it when developing R packages. It is also essential that you have the latest release of RStudio. You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item Help &gt; About RStudio. You should be using RStudio version 2023.09.1+494 (2023.09.1+494) or higher, which requires R version 3.3.0 or higher."

    "text": "What is R and RStudio and why is it important to learn and implement in all your data analysis pipelines from simple to complex? The reading below and the the materials covered during this course will answer this very question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\n\n\n\nAt the end of this lesson you will:\n\nDescribe the purpose of the RStudio Script, Console, Environment, and Plots panes.\nOrganize files and directories for a set of analyses as an R project, and understand the purpose of the working directory.\nUse the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions.\nDemonstrate how to provide sufficient information for troubleshooting with the R user community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term R is used to refer to the programming language, the environment for statistical computing, and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.\nRStudio is currently a very popular way to not only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software1. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.\nThe RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet provides much more information than will be covered here, but can be useful to learn keyboard shortcuts and discover new features.\n\n\n\nWhy you need R\n\n\n\n\nThe learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.\nWorking with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.\nWorking with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.\n\n\n\nReproducibility means that someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis code.\nR integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts or reports from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript or report are updated automatically.\nAn increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.\n\n\n\nWith 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend R’s capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyse your data.\n\n\n\nThe skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has tens, hundreds, or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you as the programmer.\nR is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient. We will cover this more in the section on data structures.\nR can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.\n\n\n\nThe plotting functions in R are extensive, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.\n\n\n\nThousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the RStudio community.

    "text": "The term R is used to refer to the programming language, the environment for statistical computing, and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.\nRStudio is currently a very popular way to not only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software1. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.\nThe RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet provides much more information than will be covered here, but can be useful to learn keyboard shortcuts and discover new features.\n\n\n\nWhy you need R\n\n\n\n\nThe learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.\nWorking with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.\nWorking with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.\n\n\n\nReproducibility means that someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis code.\nR integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts or reports from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript or report are updated automatically.\nAn increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.\n\n\n\nWith 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend R’s capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyse your data.\n\n\n\nThe skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has tens, hundreds, or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you as the programmer.\nR is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient. We will cover this more in the section on data structures.\nR can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.\n\n\n\nThe plotting functions in R are extensive, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.\n\n\n\nThousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the RStudio community. These broad user communities extend to specialized areas such as bioinformatics. One such subset of the R community is Bioconductor, a scientific project for analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays.\n\n\n\nAnyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs."

As a result, scientists today require fundamental computational and programming skill-sets to efficiently perform data analyses, generate complex models for testing, develop reproducible data analyses, and effectively communicate results through clear and meaningful graphics. However, these skills are often challenging due to a lack of structured training in data science.\nIntro to Reproducible Data Analysis Using R is a hands-on course that will introduce the R statistical software including data structures, wrangling data, plotting data, basic statistics, data modeling, and literate coding practices. There is no textbook for the course. All course materials will be provided on Canvas or this website. While no formal background in statistics or programming is necessary, a general knowledge of basic statistics, experimental design, and computer file storage systems will be helpful. All classes will involve active learning/coding activities so a laptop with power cord is required for all sessions. Students will be expected to complete readings prior to class, attend lectures to dive deeper into those topics in class, participate in classroom activities, complete projects practicing and reinforcing the computing and programming skills. There will be a final project, which will include a class presentation."
